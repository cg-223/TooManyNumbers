# Too Many Numbers
This mod succeeds *Talisman* as the goto mod for numbers above 1e308.

Too Many Numbers (TMN) uses Omeganum (from Naruyoko, ported by Mathguy23) to increase the score limit, feasibly to 10{1000}10.

TMN relies on Steamodded, and is not a lovely mod.

The main difference between TMN and Talisman is that TMN eliminates many mod incompatibility issues.

Mod developers should not need to add any support for TMN, as it will likely Just Work.
